# CSC_2463_Final_Project
### Project Description
Puzzle Runner is a simple game made with p5 Play, Tone Js, and Arduino. The objective of the game is to make it from one side of the level to the other and reach the treasure. You're an explorer and you have to avoid the mummies that spawn randomly around the map at different speeds. You have 3 lives and 60 seconds to make it to the treasure. If not, you get sent back to the starting page to try again. There's background music that speeds up as the timer gets lower, and resets to its original speed when you get sent back to the starting menu. If you make it to the end, then the music completely stops on the win page. On the win page as well, you get a note of how many seconds you had left. There are also footsteps sound effects whenever your character walks. Finally, there's coded Arduino functionality for walking and an LED for the timer.
